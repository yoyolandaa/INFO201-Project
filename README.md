We are conducting a comprehensive analysis and exploration of the decision-making process faced by individuals after college, particularly the choice between pursuing a graduate degree or entering the workforce. We hope it would be beneficial to undergraduate students and have a reference backed up by real statistics. In this storyline, we created Jamie's situation as the storyline character to understand the challenges and opportunities of each choice. We conducted the employment rate by different age categories and different educational level for Jamie, which could better help him making the decision. 

From our studying in people’s employment rate, we see a positive correlation between education and employability for all countries in our sample, showing that with a higher educational level, the rate would also be higher. Therefore, if students have the opportunity of having a higher education after undergraduate, we do encourage them to try to reach for as high an academic level as they could reach to earn a better job and would be more likely to get employed. It’s not the best choice to harsh into their careers, where they would not get such a high employment rate while they were younger than 24 anyways.
